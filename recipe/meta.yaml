  summary: a simple, fast, and powerful particle simulator
  description: |
     Particula is a simple, fast, and powerful particle simulator, or at least two of the three, we hope. 
     It is a simple particle system that is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend. 
     The goal is to have a robust aerosol (gas phase and particle phase) simulation system 
     that can be used to answer scientific questions that arise for experiments and research discussions.
